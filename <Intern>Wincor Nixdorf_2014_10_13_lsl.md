##Interview Flow
####Self-Introduction
I practice algorithm and data structure a lot.

I am a full-time linux user.

I am familiar with C and Java.

####Q&A
* "You have some experience on ARM Cortex programming right?"

> Yes. Only for Cortex-M. I haven't started any programming on Cortex-A

* He introduced the project to me. Nowadays, there is a general purpose PC inside the ATM. The PC is getting instructions from users and then giving the command to a micro-controller based board. The micro-controller is in charge of withdrawing money, etc.

* "So instead of using a high-end pc, I'm considering use Cortex-A...."

> With embedded system with linux operation system.

* "Yes. And even android, who knows"

> LOL...

* "So what do you think? I can show you our lab, the R & D centre."

> Yay, I would say, this is a challenge for me. But I would like to give it a try.

* "Yes, true. I had my master in 2000. And I write a XXXX(forgot). It took me 9 month to finish. I used Qt. Do you know that?"

> I heard that before. But I didn't use it.

* "Qt is good and powerful. If you decide to use it, I also can help you".

> ~~You are my boss right? you want to write code for me?~~

* "Or you want to use Java. I don't know. I am fine with it."

> It can be decided later. I need some further research before making decision.

* "Doesn't matter. It's not really important."

* "Your intenship is only 4 or 5 month. I don't know how long it will take for you. So, your project must be documented. Don't just write some code and that's it...

> Sure. No problem.

* "If you finish it in one week, it's fine."

> ~~laugh here~~

* "There are a lot of ARM board manufacturer. I prefer to use Freescale's ARM board. All the instructions and OS are there. If you prefer to use others. It's ok. We can buy it. Just make sure the linux system will be ready asap."

* "So, what do you say? You want to see our lab?"

> Now? Sure! It's my honor!

*So I follow him to their R & D center. (German use American English. LOL)*

*When we are wait for lift*

> So, how long have you been Singapore?

* "Me? Oh, no.... (I didn't understand him).... How about you? You from China?"

> Yes. This is my 3rd year in SG.

* "We also have company in China. But they will not use your project unless you use their encryption algorithms."

> Haha. Maybe their specifications are not them same comparing to other customers.


> So, actually, the project can be divided in to 2 parts right? the OS are ready. What I need to do is to write a driver that interfacing with the microcontroller. And make sure the communication is encrypted? The other part is the GUI client right?"

* "Yes. The encryption code are also ready. It's just only for Windows"

* "99% ATM are using Windows. I think it's a mistake from beginning."

> LOL. I agree!

####Coding/Programming Test
None

He didn't even ask anything about C or Java.

####Questions for the interviewers
> It seems like I'm the only one who will be working on this project? Or it's in a team?

* Not really. We are outsourcing some projects from SUTD and NTU also. If they have a group of students working on these, then we may want to see how it works.

* I can help. But sometimes I'm fully occupied.
 
> Ya... Understand...

##Summary
Acknowledge their project is valuable.

Show your willings to take the challenge.

####Improvement/Suggestions
Catch interviewer's jokes...And laugh a bit(maybe = =||).
